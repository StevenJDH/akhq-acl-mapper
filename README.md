AKHQ ACL Mapper is a custom protocol mapper for Keycloak that supports AKHQ's latest ACL requirements as of version 0.25.0 when using [Direct OIDC mapping](https://akhq.io/docs/configuration/authentifications/oidc.html#direct-oidc-mapping). This mapper is only meant to be used as a simple way to transition from previous AKHQ versions for simple setups that used group attributes to adapt the UI to a logged in user. Because of this, many features like multi-cluster support are not supported, but the script may be useful as a base to adapt to any other needs.

## Features
* Maps previous `topics-filter-regexp`, `connects-filter-regexp`, `consumer-groups-filter-regexp` group attributes to new ACLs.
* Avoids use of `*-writer` roles to prevent users with `topics/create` or `connect/create` roles from creating disallowed resources.
* Automatically creates the parent `groups` claim for the ACL substructure.
* Basic debugging support.

## Prerequisites
* [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/downloads) 25.0.0 or newer (20.0.0+ may also work).
* [AKHQ](https://github.com/tchiotludo/akhq/releases) 0.25.0 or newer.
* Java 17+ ([Temurin/Adopt](https://adoptium.net)) OpenJDK if building the Java-based project.
* Optional: [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) 3.8.4+ CLI for compiling the Java-based project.

## Building
The following are the build steps needed for both flavors of the mapper available in this repo.

**Java-based project**

To build the JAR file, run the following command inside the `java` folder:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

There should now be a file called `akhq-acl-mapper-<version>-bin.jar` in the `target` folder that can be used for deploying the mapper.

**Node.js-based project**

To build the JAR file, zip together the `META-INF` folder and the `akhq-acl-mapper-script.js` file found in the `nodejs` folder. After, change the `.zip` extension to the `.jar` extension. For more information, see [Create a JAR with the scripts to deploy](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#create-a-jar-with-the-scripts-to-deploy).

## Usage
The following describes what is needed to get up and running with this mapper.

### Install custom provider for traditional setups
When using a traditional setup, place the JAR file into the `providers` folder of Keycloak. Restart the Keycloak server with the following command:

**Java-based mapper**

```bash
bin/kc.[sh|bat] start-dev
```

> [!TIP]  
> Ignore SPI warning (KC-SERVICES0047) for implementing the internal SPI protocol-mapper, it's expected. See keycloak/keycloak#9974 for more information.

**Node.js-based mapper**

```bash
bin/kc.[sh|bat] start-dev --features=scripts
```

> [!NOTE]  
> These command examples start Keycloak in development mode for testing only. The command used for the Node.js mapper also enables the required scripts preview feature in order to be supported.

### Install custom provider for Kubernetes setups
When using a Kubernetes setup with Keycloak installed via the Bitnami Helm Chart, modify the chartÂ´s `values.yaml` file to include the following configuration:

**Java-based mapper**

```yaml
initdbScripts:
  load_custom_provider_script.sh: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Running load_custom_provider_script.sh..."
    curl -SsLf https://github.com/StevenJDH/akhq-acl-mapper/releases/download/0.2.0/akhq-acl-mapper.jar -o /opt/bitnami/keycloak/providers/akhq-acl-mapper.jar

containerSecurityContext:
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
```

**Node.js-based mapper**

```yaml
initdbScripts:
  load_custom_provider_script.sh: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Running load_custom_provider_script.sh..."
    curl -SsLf https://github.com/StevenJDH/akhq-acl-mapper/releases/download/0.2.0/akhq-acl-mapper-script.jar -o /opt/bitnami/keycloak/providers/akhq-acl-mapper-script.jar

extraEnvVars:
  - name: KEYCLOAK_EXTRA_ARGS
    value: "--features=scripts"

containerSecurityContext:
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The configuration used for the Node.js mapper enables the required scripts preview feature in order to be supported.

### Configure user group attributes
Ensure that the user group attributes match the `topics-filter-regexp`, `connects-filter-regexp`, `consumer-groups-filter-regexp` keys. If they don't, then they will either need to be updated or the script adjusted to match.

### Add custom protocol mapper
In Keycloak, perform the following steps:

1. Go to `Clients`, select the client used for AKHQ, and navigate to the `Client scopes` tab.
2. Select the `<akhq>-dedicated` item in the list.
3. Click the `Configure a new mapper` or `Add mapper > By configuration` button, and select the `AKHQ ACL Mapper` type in the list that appears.
4. Configure the mapper as follows:
   * **Name:** akhq-acl-mapper
   * **Token Claim Name:** groups (Must match setting in AKHQ for `akhq.security.oidc.<label>.groups-field`)
   * **Claim JSON Type:** JSON
   * **Add to ID token:** On
   * **Add to access token:** Off

### Testing the mapper
Under the `Client scopes` tab of the AKHQ client configuration, select the `Evaluate` sub-tab. In the `Users` field, select a user associated with a group that has attributes configured for AKHQ. Then, on the right, click the `Generated ID token` button. There should now be a groups claim in the generated token on the left that has the required ACL structure similar to the following:
